# asynctopia

## What
A Clojure library designed to assist with asynchronous processing (in the context of `core.async`).

## Why
`core.async` is a powerful tool - not very different to a sharp knife. One can do wonderful or terrible things with a sharp knife.
The primary goal here is to provide solid high-level constructs in order to help people avoid common traps and pitfalls. 
As a secondary goal I'm trying to provide some trivial utilities that have been requested through the official `core.async` JIRA.
Finally, I realised that channel buffers do NOT need to be type-hinted as `LinkedList` - a mere `Deque` suffices. 
This alone opens up the door for more flexible constructor functions that would allow any `Deque` impl - in fact `ArrayDeque` 
sounds like a great candidate for a default, but `LinkedList` can still be supported. Therefore, I went ahead and implemented 
two sets (regular VS thread-safe) of the three buffers (fixed, dropping, sliding), along with a convenient constructor function 
that supports everything (see `buffers/buf` leveraged by `channels/chan`).

## Where
FIXME

## How
### asynctopia.null
Contains two functions for dealing with `nil`. Writers will want to use `converting` right before putting, 
whereas readers will want to use `restoring` right after taking. Following this pattern/convention provides
nil-safety to producers (`nil` may be a perfectly valid value, but cannot be conveyed via a channel), 
and transparency to consumers (they will receive what was actually produced). Without this dance, you have to 
carefully vet every single producer that interacts with `core.async`, and that is not easy.
  
See `asynctopia.ops/>!?` for a higher-level construct that makes use of this, and is a good candidate for by writers 
(as opposed to the lower-level `converting` macro). 

### asynctopia.ops
#### pipe-with \[f from & {:keys \[error! buffer\]}\]
Pipes the `from` channel into a newly created output-channel 
returning the latter. Errors thrown by `f` are handled with `error!` 
(defaults to simply printing the error message). 

Honors the `asynctopia.null` convention. 

#### sink-with \[f ch error!\]
Generic sinking `go-loop`. Fully consumes the provided channel 
passing the taken values through `f` (presumably side-effecting, ideally non-blocking).
Errors thrown by `f` are handled with `error!` (defaults to simply printing the error message).

Honors the `asynctopia.null` convention. 

#### mix-with \[f out-chan in-chans error!\]
Creates a `mix` against `out-chan`, adds all `in-chans` to it,
and starts sinking `out-chan` with `f`. Returns the `mix` object.

You will need to close `out-chan` in order to stop the mixing/sinking loops 
(i.e. closing `in-chans` or unmixing  won't suffice). 

Honors the `asynctopia.null` convention. 

#### drain \[ch\]
Drains the provided channel, disregarding its contents.

#### <!?deliver \[ch p\]
Takes from channel `ch` and delivers the value to promise `p`.
Honors the `asynctopia.null` convention. 

#### >!? \[ch x\]
Nil-safe variant of `>!` (i.e. If `x` is nil, will put `:asynctopia.null/nil`). 

#### merge-reduce \[f init chan & chans\]
Merges all channels and reduces them with `f`.

### asynctopia.core
#### consuming-with \[consume! from & {:keys \[error? error! to-error buffer\]}\]
Sets up two `go` loops for consuming values VS errors (identified by the `error?` predicate) 
from the `from` channel. Values are consumed via `consume!`, whereas errors via `error!`.
The ideal consuming fns would submit to some thread-pool, send-off to some agent, 
or something along these lines (i.e. non-blocking). Both `go` loops gracefully terminate when `from` is closed.

The three optional error fns are semantically related. Observe the defaults as a guide: 
 
 - `to-error` default uses `identity` (returns the Throwable itself) 
 - `error?` default recognises the Throwable
 - `error!` default prints (via `println`) the message of the Throwable

If for example your `to-error` fn constructed an error-map (from the Throwable), then your `error?` 
would typically check that the map contains some error key, and your `error!` would do something 
with the value of that key. 

Honors the `asynctopia.null` convention. 

#### pkeep \[f coll & {:keys \[error! in-flight async?\]\]}
Parallel keep (bounded by `in-flight`) of `f` across `coll` (via `pipeline-blocking`).
Errors thrown by `f` are handled with `error!`. Returns a channel containing the single 
(collection) result (i.e. take one item).

Does NOT honor the `asynctopia.null` convention (and that's why it's not called `pmap`).  

#### with-timeout \[ms timeout-val & body\]
Returns a channel which will (eventually) receive either the result of `(do body)`, 
or `timeout-val` (whichever comes first).

### asynctopia.pubsub 
#### pub-sub! \[in topic-fn topics & {:keys \[error? error! to-error topic->buffer topic->nconsumers\]\]}
Configuration-driven (`topics`) pub-sub infrastructure.
Creates a `pub` against channel `in` with `topic-fn` and`topic->buffer` 
(maps topic-keys to custom buffers - see `pub`).
Then sets up subscriptions against the publication for all topics.
`topics` must be either a map from topic to its process-fn (1-arg), 
or a vector of two elements - the list of topics followed by a common 
process-fn (2-arg, the topic-key first). Finally, and since we know 
the processing-fn per topic, sets-up consuming loops (again buffered per `topic->buffer`) 
for all subscriptions. The number of consuming loops per subscription is controlled by 
`topic->nconsumers` (a map from topic-key => positive integer, defaults to 1).
Returns a vector of 2 elements - the publication, and the subscription channels.
This can form the basis of a simple (in-process) event-bus (events arrive,
and distributed to their respective topic processors).
